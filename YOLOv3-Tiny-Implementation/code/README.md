### Requirements for each program to compile:

> LiDAR requires  [ OPENCV, PCL ]
> STEREO requires [ OPENCV, ZED] , ZED requires CUDA.


All the resources such as the neural network weights and configuration files are located in each program: folder /build/res/

For LiDAR, there is a pcd point cloud reader called pcd_read located
in the /build/res folder. 

Run on linux using: 
`./pcd_read < .pcd file >`

Some testing pcd files are included in res/

As the training data is in RGB, the CNN only detects LiDAR information with RGB values not intensity.

For Stereo, the config and weights for YOLOV3-tiny all located in /build/res/

To compile the individual code (the compiled executable is also include in the build directory), navigate to the build folder in a linux terminal for each program and use:
`cmake .. && make`

To compile the code:

Run LiDAR with: `./perception <.pcd file>`
Run STEREO with: `./perception`

> If no ZED cam is found, any webcam built into the device will be used.
