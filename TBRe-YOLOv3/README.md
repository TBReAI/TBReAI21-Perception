### Description

This folder will contain the code for TBReAI's ensembled object detection model. The original YOLOv3 code was cloned from [https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3).

The expected completion date is May 2021. Final code will be published once the project is completed.

An example of one of the images we have labeled using Labelbox to gain access to the FSOCO dataset is displayed below.
