### Description

This folder contains the code for TBReAI's ensembled object detection model. The original YOLOv3 code was cloned from [https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3).

This is still a work in progress. The expected completion date is May 2021. 

An example of one of the images we have labeled using Labelbox to gain access to the FSOCO dataset is displayed below.
