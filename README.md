# TBReAI21 Perception
### Computationally Efficient Perception for Autonomous Racing

Building the perception pipeline for Team Bath Racing Electric's 2021 autonomous racing car. The code for the 2020 implementation of the perception pipeline can be found [here](old-implementation/code).

The video below displays how the 2020 implementation of the perception pipeline detects and classifies cones for the purpose of autonomous racing.

The goal of the current implementation is to build a low-latency, high-accuracy, computationally-efficient perception system that can be deployed on our vehicle for the **2020 FS-AI competition**.

##### UPDATE
> Currently working on gaining access to the FSOCO dataset.
##### UPDATE
> Until we gain access to the FSOCO dataset for our 2021 implementation, we will be using the MIT driverless open source dataset.
